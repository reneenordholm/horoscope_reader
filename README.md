# Horoscope Reader

Horoscope Reader is a command line interface that scrapes data from Horoscope.com to present the user's selected horoscope.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'horoscope_reader'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install horoscope_reader

## Usage

 To access the horoscope, install the gem as described above and run the CLI program the terminal.  User will be presented with 12 astrological signs to choose from by number.  Upon entering the number associated with the user's sign, the program will then output the user's horoscope for the current day and ask the user if they would like to view another horoscope.  If the user selects the option to view another horoscope, the program will run again, displaying the list of available signs for the user to pick from; if the user does not wish to view another horoscope, the program will say goodbye to the user and exit.
